# blueprints
Some Home Assistant blueprints I have updated, intially forked from https://github.com/OliverHi/blueprints/tree/f010d88630fa3e0d68074905b1258e8580f3b2f6

## Motion brightness light
This is based on the original from OliverHi, I've removed the restriction of allowing only motion sensors as triggers (I am using doors for some triggers) and added day/night modes where different brightnesses are set depending on whether it's day or night
