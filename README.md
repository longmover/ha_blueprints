Some Home Assistant blueprints I have updated and expanded

## Motion brightness light
This is based on the original from OliverHi, I've removed the restriction of allowing only motion sensors as triggers (I am using doors for some triggers) and added day/night modes where different brightnesses are set depending on whether it's day or night.  Also supports the setting of transition time.
